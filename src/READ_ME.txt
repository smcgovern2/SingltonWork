Create two new classes:
- ThreadSafeCalcTool        Create a Singleton that is ThreadSafe
- EnumCalcTool              Create a Singleton that utilizes an Enum

Modify the Main class to use both classes.  For each Singleton, there should be the four BMI's to calcuate and the
average should be printed.  Both Singletons should produce the same output.
